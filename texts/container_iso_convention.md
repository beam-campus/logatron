A shipping container is identified and characterized by several standardized properties and markings that ensure it can be tracked, handled, and used efficiently across various modes of transportation. Here's a detailed look at how a container is identified and its key properties:

### 1. **Container Identification**

Containers are primarily identified by a unique combination of characters and numbers, along with specific markings:

- **Container Number**: This is an alphanumeric code that uniquely identifies each container. It consists of:

  - **Owner Code**: The first three letters represent the owner or operator of the container (e.g., MAEU for Maersk).
  - **Equipment Category Identifier**: The fourth letter is usually 'U,' denoting that it's a container (e.g., MAEU).
  - **Serial Number**: The next six digits are the unique serial number assigned to that container (e.g., 123456).
  - **Check Digit**: The final digit is a check digit used to validate the container number (e.g., MAEU 123456 7). The check digit is calculated using a specific algorithm.
- **ISO Code**: This is a four-character code that identifies the type and size of the container according to ISO standards (e.g., 22G1 for a standard 20-foot general-purpose container).
- **Size and Type Code**: Indicates the container's dimensions and type (e.g., 45G0 for a 45-foot high cube container).

### 2. **Container Properties**

Containers have several key properties that define their physical characteristics and capabilities:

- **Size**: Standard sizes are defined by ISO, including:

  - **20-foot**: Typically 20 feet long, 8 feet wide, and 8.5 feet high.
  - **40-foot**: Typically 40 feet long, 8 feet wide, and 8.5 feet high.
  - **High Cube**: Similar to standard lengths but usually 9.5 feet high.
  - **45-foot**: Typically 45 feet long and 9.5 feet high.
- **Type**: Various types are available to handle different kinds of cargo:

  - **General Purpose**: Standard containers for general cargo.
  - **Reefer (Refrigerated)**: For temperature-sensitive cargo.
  - **Open Top**: For oversized cargo that won't fit through standard doors.
  - **Flat Rack**: For heavy and oversized cargo.
  - **Tank Containers**: For liquids and gases.
- **Capacity**:

  - **Cubic Capacity**: Volume of the container, measured in cubic meters (m³).
  - **Maximum Gross Weight**: The maximum allowable weight of the container including its contents, typically in kilograms (kg) or pounds (lbs).
  - **Tare Weight**: The weight of the empty container.
  - **Payload**: The maximum weight of the cargo that the container can carry (Maximum Gross Weight - Tare Weight).
- **Markings and Labels**:

  - **CSC Plate**: A safety approval plate indicating that the container complies with the International Convention for Safe Containers (CSC).
  - **Maximum Gross and Tare Weight**: Marked on the container's exterior.
  - **Owner's Logo and Details**: Often painted on the container’s sides.
  - **Handling Instructions**: Various symbols for handling and storage instructions (e.g., "This Way Up," "Fragile").
- **Structural Features**:

  - **Doors**: Typically located at one end, with locking mechanisms for security.
  - **Corner Castings**: Reinforced corners for lifting and securing the container.
  - **Forklift Pockets**: Slots for forklift handling (in some containers).
  - **Ventilation**: Vent openings to prevent moisture build-up (in some containers).
